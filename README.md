# TOOL1_FINAL_PROJECT
Final Project for DST1 

The data for this project was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/machinemind/top-rated-movies-in-imdb. The csv file is also contained in this repository.

This project looks at the gross (in millions) that a movie makes in the box office across other variables (genre, runtime, year of release) to see if any patterns can be found.
